Overview

The High-Entropy Alloys Generation Model (HEA-Gen) is a sophisticated computational toolkit designed to facilitate the research and development of novel high-entropy materials. This model is capable of generating high-entropy nanostructures, bulk materials, and perovskite system architectures. It integrates advanced Differential Evolution Entropy Descriptor (DEED) for entropy estimation and the Conditional Crystallographic Discrete Variational Encoder (cond-CDVE) for structural generation.

Features

	•	DEED Entropy Estimation: Utilizes the Differential Evolution algorithm to accurately estimate the configurational entropy of complex alloys.
	•	cond-CDVE Structure Generation: Employs a conditional generative model to predict feasible crystal structures based on input chemical compositions and desired properties.
	•	Material Types: Supports generation of nano, bulk, and perovskite high-entropy alloys.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Offers a streamlined command-line interface for easy operation and integration into existing workflows.
